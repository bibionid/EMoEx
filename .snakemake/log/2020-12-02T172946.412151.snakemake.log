Relative file path './results//input1.txt' starts with './'. This is redundant and strongly discouraged. It can also lead to inconsistent results of the file-matching approach used by Snakemake. You can simply omit the './' for relative file paths.
File path ./results//input1.txt contains double '/'. This is likely unintended. It can also lead to inconsistent results of the file-matching approach used by Snakemake.
Relative file path './results//input2.txt' starts with './'. This is redundant and strongly discouraged. It can also lead to inconsistent results of the file-matching approach used by Snakemake. You can simply omit the './' for relative file paths.
