EMotEP: Earlham Motif Extrapolation pipeline
############################################

EMotEP is a Snakemake based pipeline developed to lift-over regulatory motif
annotations drawn from ChIP-seq data. The pipeline is designed to use data from
well annotated model species, and lift-over to species which have annotated
genomes but no regulatory motif annotations.
